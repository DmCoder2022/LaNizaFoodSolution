# LaNizaFoodSolution
A food app I tried to make which allows the user to:
1. Save their contact details
2. Choose any number of foods, combos, drinks, etc and adds it to their order list.
3. Gives a summary of all the orders made with the total price.
However, I struggle to get the second function to work: The part where the user's orders are supposed to be stored in a List of Orders object
The following error occurs when I try to do so:

System.NullReferenceException
  HResult=0x80004003
  Message=Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
  Source=LaNizaFoodProj
  StackTrace:
   at LaNizaFoodProj.UserControlFoodMenus.btnAddOrder_Click(Object sender, EventArgs e) in line 103.
   
   Any suggestions, advice or help will really be appreciated a lot. Thank you.
